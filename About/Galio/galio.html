            <h2>Modelling my favourite demacian colossus.</h2>
            <p>
                I've been playing a LOT of League of Legends lately, and after watching FAKER play Galio at Worlds' 24,
                I just had to start playing him as well. And boy, did I play him. So much so that I fell into the
                incredible
                state of being addicted to the character. I love his lore, design, abilities, and playstyle.
                I love everything about him. So, I decided to model him.
            </p>

            <div class="row">
                <img src="../../Images/PageImages/Galio/Galio01.jpg" class="two">

            </div>
            <p>
                I started with a wireframe of the character and slowly built up the clay around it. I had to be very
                careful with the proportions and the pose of the character, as I wanted to capture the essence of the
                character in the model.
            </p>

            <p>
                It was at this stage that the confidence I had to continue skyrocketed. I love the way his hand and
                fingers came out, and I locked in for the rest.
            </p>

            <div class="row">
                <img src="../../Images/PageImages/Galio/Galio04.jpg" class="two">
                <img src="../../Images/PageImages/Galio/Galio05.jpg" class="two">

                The wings were a challenge, but they were the model's most fun and rewarding part. I used a
                bunch of aluminum foil to get the curve and profile of the wings right and, not to toot my own horn,
                But they came out pretty well.

            <h2>Bringing regality to the figurine.</h2>
            <p>
                Saying the gold paint elevated the model would be a massive understatement. It brought out the regality
                of the character and made the model look orders of magnitude closer to the original (and diverted
                attention away from some mildly unsightly areas XD).

            <p>
                I had a lot of fun modeling this guy, and I'm delighted with how he turned out, considering this was
                my first modeling attempt.
                I learned a lot about how clay behaves at different levels of dryness and have a lot more confidence in
                myself for the next one.
                I definitely have more respect for the artists who model characters.
                Thank you, Riot, for making a legend so extraordinary that it inspired me to start modeling.
                <br><br>Best 72 hours spent in a while!
