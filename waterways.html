            This project started out as an attempt to recreate the effect outlined in 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMTeCqNkId8" class="link1">this video</a> based of
            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/generative/comments/xz7tlf/comparison_with_and_without_raytracing_for_my_2d/" class="link1">this reddit post</a>.<br>
            It however, quickly became one of my most favorite projects to work on. The implementation I came up with used Compute Shaders. Being the first time I worked with them it was both super exciting and terrifying.

            Similar to how the video progresses, I started out with a height map. I used Perlin Noise in octaves to get organic looking islands and added a small
            function to help isolate the noise generation to the center of the screen.
