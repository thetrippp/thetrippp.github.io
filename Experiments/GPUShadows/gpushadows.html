            <h1>GPU Instanced Mesh-based Shadows</h1>
            <h2>Why?</h2>
            <p>
                Working on project for the mobile platforms, brings a ton of hurdles with respect to the capabilities of the hardware and the limits of the systems you can build.<br>
                One of these challenges was that you can only have one directional light casting shadows at a time. This was a problem because I wanted to have multiple dynamic objects casting shadows at the same time.
                After tinkering around the idea and my brilliant designer outright challenging me that I couldn't do it, I decided to take a stab at it with murderous intent.

            <p>
                I am cleaning up some of the code and will be posting a demo soon. Stay tuned!
