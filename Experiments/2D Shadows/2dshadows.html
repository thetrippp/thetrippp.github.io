            <h2>Understanding Light Falloffs</h2>
            <p>
                There are 2 main types of light falloffs: radial and angular, which govern the falloffs with respect to
                distance and the angular deviation from the direction of propogation.<br>
                The intensities and falloffs are calculated using the following formulae:<br>
            <div class="code">float radialFalloff = pow(1.0 - dist, fallOff);</div><br>
            <div class="code">float angularFalloff = 1 - smoothstep(0, maxAngle, abs(angle));</div><br>
            The final intensity is calculated as the product of the radial and angular falloffs with some base light
            intensity to control how the light appears.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                The "light" is calculated and rendered in the fragment function of an unlit shader. The position, size,
                and rotation are dynamically computed and rendered as the material of a quad.
                Using stencil buffers, the light is rendered with the option to be blocked out by a "shadow-caster" in
                later stages.

            <h2>Procedural Shadow Caster Generation</h2>
            <p>
                This an extension to my lights experiment cause you can't have lights without shadows :)<br>
                As I understand, shadow caster meshes are generated behind the scenes when working in 2D with lights in
                the Unity game engine.
                I thought this would be an excellent opportunity to explore stencil buffers and the fascinating topic of
                Geometry Shaders!<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                Construction of the shadow caster mesh works in 8 stages:<br>
                &emsp;1. For every triangle in the mesh, add 2 more points, as shown in the first image above.<br>
                &emsp;2. Join the new points to the existing points as shown to form 2 new triangles.<br>
                &emsp;3. Set the normals of the new vertices to be the same as the closest surface, as shown(in
                yellow).<br>
                &emsp;4. Find a vector from each vertex to the light source's position.<br>
                &emsp;5. Calculate the dot product between the vertices' normals and the vector to the light
                position.<br>
                &emsp;6. Get all vertices whose dot product is negative.<br>
                &emsp;(This means that the surface is facing away from the light.)<br>
                &emsp;7. Project these vertices in the opposite direction to the light.<br>
                &emsp;8. Shade the mesh with stencils appropriately to get "SHADOWS!!" *cue angel sounds*.<br><br><br>
            </p>

                Tested only with very basic meshes. Preliminary tests suggest my current system will only work for
                convex meshes, but I need to test further and confirm. I also haven't considered rotations, so rotating
                the mesh for now gives weird artifacting. Performance is excellent, also because I'm working with just a
                handful
                of vertices.

                Highly inspired by <b>Noel Berry</b>, the brilliant programmer who built the lights and another system
                for <b>Celeste!</b>
                Although he built his system with textures, and I'm using mesh manipulation, I feel like this experiment
                helped me
                Clear a vital hurdle: starting to use geometry shaders. I think that is awesome in its own regard.

                "Shadows" being cast against the "light." Works smoothly even when the mesh is scaled.

                I will continue working on this concept and eventually have a working implementation of texture-based 2D
                lights. <br>
                but until then, Cheers!
