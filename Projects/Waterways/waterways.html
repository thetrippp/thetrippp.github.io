                This project started out as an attempt to recreate the effect outlined in
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMTeCqNkId8" class="link" target="_blank">this
                    video</a> based
                of
                <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/generative/comments/xz7tlf/comparison_with_and_without_raytracing_for_my_2d/"

                However, it quickly became one of my favorite projects. The implementation I came up with used a Compute
                Shaders. Being the first time I worked with them was exciting and terrifying.
                <br><br>
            <p> I started with a height map as the video progressed. I used Perlin Noise in octaves to get
                organic-looking islands and added a small
                function to help isolate the noise generation to the center of the screen.</p>

            <p>
                A visually captivating island-like landform is created by applying discrete colors over sets of value
                ranges of the height map. This versatile technique highlights the distinct features of beaches,
                grasslands, and mountains and gives the landmass shapes an organic look with well-defined detail in
                interesting areas. Most importantly, it empowers you to create diverse and unique terrains, fostering
                creativity and innovation in your projects. Â </p>

                Using the height values, an unlit shader is employed to "ray march" through the texture, a key step in
                the technique. The shader is significantly enhanced with a sun's position, a crucial vector direction
                that guides and dictates the ray marching process. Depending on conditions, rays either "escape" the
                landmass boundaries concerning the simulated vertical direction or intersect with the height values in
                the direction of the ray march, creating a lit or in-shadow region of the landmass. A shadow mask is
                combined with the colored stage to make a ray-marched 3D-looking island.</p>

            <p>
                Another feature I wanted to add was waves periodically crashing into the beach. In a compute shader
                kernel, I defined an area that would circumvent the landmass and provide a mask that would contain
                information about the nearest shore point, a vector pointing to it, and the magnitude of that vector.
                This mask (I love how pretty vector fields look) allows another shader to calculate periodic values that
                can be used to compute waves whose thickness, speed, and coherence can be controlled at runtime.
                Although visually appealing, the initial stage of these waves lacked a natural feel. I used another
                higher frequency, higher scale layer of noise to add some offsets into the mask values. Incorporating
                these noise values into the waves' shader provided a satisfying wave motion, resulting in a final
                terrain that is not just visually appealing but also deeply satisfying.</p>

                Adding some simple noise-based clouds that pan and scroll over time results in this

                While working on some optimizations, I will be smug that all the real-time processes run within 2ms and
                at ~500fps. HEHE<br>
                Unfortunately, the WebGL platform did not support compute shaders at the time of development, and I am
                facing some issues with packaging them.
                I will have a demo that you can download soon.
