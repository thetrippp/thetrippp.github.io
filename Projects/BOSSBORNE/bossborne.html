                Game built for the CI7500 : 3D Games Programming Course at Kingston University.
            </p>
            <p>
                Procedural Generation was a key feature of the game. The game was built in Unity with C# and HLSL.
                The terrain and environment was generated with the Day as the seed. This ensured that the world would be
                new everyday.
            </p>

            <p>
                Another component to the environment was the was it provided feedback to the player on its different
                "biomes". Movement speed was an area that provided the maximum feedback to the player.
                The difference in speeds on the surfaces gave the player a sense of the environment they were in.
            </p>
            <img src="../../Images/PageImages/BOSSBORNE/BOSSBORNE_Environment.gif" class="three">
            <p>
                Speaking of movement, an entirely custom character controller was implemented. The controller was built
                to be responsive and give the player a sense of control with an added layer of fluid response when
                navigating the environment. This was accomplished by implementing the Collide and Slide Algorithm, a
                robust algorithm that focuses on the intuitive redirection of velocities upon surface interactions
                rather than arresting them to provide a smoother and more responsive movement experience.
                <br><br>
                An interseting feature I had the oppportunity to work on and implement is one that uses the Adaptive
                Triggers of the PS5 Dualsense Controllers. Certain player actions like attacking and jumping consume
                stamina(the blue value on the top right). This stamina bar ties in with the triggers. Being low on
                stamina not only means that your actions in the game are limited, it also physically gets harder to push
                the corresponding buttons to perform the action.
            </p>

            <h2>Enter ChatGPT</h2>
            <p>
                A key feature of the game was the interaction with the AI. An AI companion, "Questra", was built using
                OpenAI's ChatGPT.
                Interacting with Questra through voice commands, allows the player to get quests among other things.
                Questra, through ChatGPT, generates quests with details like the location, the objective and the number
                of items required, and the enemies and their attributes. Components of a generated quest are then
                populated in the game world for the player to complete.
            </p>

                Enemies have their own State Machines and reflect them with their animations. <br>
                Note: Pixel art is extremely difficult to do especially in the month and a half we got to make this
                game. Please bear with me for using a certain asset from a character that rhymes with Dowser.
                On that note, my thanks to the artist, gamekrazzy, for the asset. <a href="https://gamekrazzy.itch.io/"

                Upon quest completion, the player is rewarded with a talisman. The talismans are generated by ChatGPT
                and have their own attributes. The player can equip these talismans to gain different altered stats. The
                talisman's attributes and values are generated in accordance to the difficulty of the quest that was
                completed. Asking Questra for a difficult quest would give better talismans on completion with the added
                challenge of enemies with better stats. Talismans can stack their attributes so the order of tailsman
                application can vastly vary the effects provided.

            <h1>The Titular Feature</h1>
            <h2>BOSSES!</h2>
            <p>
                The Bosses in Bossborne are the highlight of the game. The bosses are generated by ChatGPT and have
                their own attributes, stats and a title and appearance. The bosses have their own State Machines and
                animations.
                The name and title are generated randomly and a color palette that corresponds to the title is
                generated. A shader is the used to apply the palette to the boss. This results in a unique boss every
                time in both name, appearance and stats.
            </p>
            <img src="../../Images/PageImages/BOSSBORNE/BOSSBORNE_Bosses.gif" class="three">
            <p>
                To enhance boss fight experiences, I developed a system that allows bosses to record player gameplay and
                construct a probability map of the moves that the player would likely do given a position, direction and
                state. This information is accumulated over a fixed interval(now at 30 seconds) and then is acted on by
                a statistically driven probability model to determine the likely player move. A counter state is
                achieved which dictates the direction and state the boss must take to avoid damage.
            </p>
            <img src="../../Images/PageImages/BOSSBORNE/BOSSBORNE_BossesLearn.gif" class="three">
            <p>
                To say that the bosses are difficult would be an understatement. Attacking would leave the player
                vulnerable to counter attacks, which, with the boss being MUCH stronger than quest enemies spell a LOT
                of trouble. Respawns exist in the game with the caveat that the player loses all their acquired
                talismans and quest progress.

                It was a ton of fun building this game and I enjoyed integrating ChatGPT into my systems. It was
                definitely an extensive iterative process to fine-tune the prompts to get acceptable results and
                certainly did not send me into a flying rage on a few occasions.
                I have plenty of ideas to extend the game both content wise and system wise. I hope to get back to it
                soon.

                In the mean time I will be putting up the demo here.<br>
                I have some changes I need to make and the game will be down for a bit. Stay tuned for the update!
                <br>
                Until then, enjoy BOSSBORNE!

                You WILL need a PS5 controller to play the demo. Might have some input artifacts with other controllers.
