            <p>
                Welcome to my Final Project/Dissertation for my master's degree in Game Development(Programming) at
                Kingston University.<br>
                Being heavily inspired by Alexander Sannikov's implemention of <a
                    href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L6v1_7HY2X-LV3Ofb6oyTIxgEaP4LOI6/view" class="link"
                    target="_blank">Radiance Cascades</a> to generate beautiful and not to forget, performant Global
                Illumination and Vercidium's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6EuAUjq92k&t=1s" class="link" target="_blank">Raytraced Audio</a>, I felt that an approach combining the two could be used to compute environment aware, spatial audio
                using cascading ray-tracing.
            </p>
            <p>
                With Unity's spatial audio implementation, audio attenuation does not occur accurately to the
                environment, as seen in the first set of images. Here, the speaker symbol is the audio source that is
                playing a continous tone.<br>
                The colors refer to the intensity of the audio at that position, with redder colors being higher and
                bluer being lower passing through a spectrum of intermediate colors.
            </p>

            <p>
                Other than the falloff in intensity with distance, there is no attenuation with the environment as there
                is a radial drop off in the intensities recorded.<br>
                To solve this, I am developing the Aural Cascades method.
            </p>
            <p>
                The method involves using a grid of "Aural Probes" to continuously perform spatial ray-tracing around
                the environment to gather potential paths to audio sources.<br>
                With the grid in place, we can tap into the audio stream using the OnFilteredRead method to intercept
                the current audion and manipulate the intensity as per required.<br>
                Once calculated, the audio listener then performs a bilinear interpolation sampling of its grid cell
                vertices to apply the final attenuation to the audio source.<br>
                This provides for a very intuitive and organic audio experience.<br>
                This is the resultant sound intensity profile with Aural Cascades enabled.<br>

            <p>
                While this current method's performance is dependant on the number of audio sources in the scene, there are many optimizations that I will be implementing, such as spreading the calculations across frames, spatially hashing the audio sources and performing a flood fill algorithm to determing those which will be encountered etc. <br>
                Stay tuned for more updates.
